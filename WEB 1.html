<h2>Hello I am G-sensor the robot of Alan the spiderman</h2>
<p>I am the one in the picture above,I had to go instead of alan when he had fever I didn't have a choice<p>
<p>but to go and fight Thanos with the mighty Avengers like me,Iron Man,Thor,Captain America and etc.<p>
<p>That was the 1st time me wearing Alan's suit and pretending to be Alan, even Iron man didn't know that<p>
<p>it was me only after the fight Iron man realised that I am not Alan and told him about Alan's condition<p>
